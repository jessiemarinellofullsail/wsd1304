	<div id="columnContent">
		<p><strong>Horticulture</strong> is the science, technology, &amp; business involved in intensive plant cultivation for human use. 
		It is practiced from the individual level in a garden up to the activities of a multinational corporation. It is very diverse in 
		its activities, incorporating plants for food (fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, culinary herbs) and non-food crops (flowers, 
		trees and shrubs, turf-grass, hops, medicinal herbs). It also includes related services in plant conservation, landscape restoration, 
		landscape and garden design/construction/maintenance, horticultural therapy, and much more. This range of food, medicinal, environmental, 
		and social products and services are all fundamental to developing and maintaining human health and well-being.</p>
